# flappy-bird-game-java
Flappy Bird in Java is a simple 2D game where players control a bird navigating through a series of pipes without touching them. The objective is to keep the bird afloat by clicking or pressing a key to make it "flap" while gravity pulls it downward. The game continues until the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
